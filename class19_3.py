""" 
Write the class "Student". The class has the attributes student_id which is an 
integer and a list of 4 grades. The class has the following methods:

A constructor that takes two parameters: 
    the studentâ€˜s ID (an integer), 
    the student's grades (as a list of strings). 
The constructor uses the parameters to initializes the attributes and convert the grades to a list of floats.
You need to implement functionality so that a Student instance can be printed using the print() function. 
When printed the Student shoud be printed as follows:
                Student ID: 173
                Grades: [5.37, 4.65, 9.85, 10.00]

you should override the < operator which checks whether an instance of the class is less than another instance of the class. 
The comparison is made using the average grade of the instances.
