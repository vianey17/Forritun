"""
You need to write the class StringSet, which contains a set of strings 
(a set only contains one instance of each element). A main program which tests the class is given. 
You should also create a standalone function which takes a StringSet instance and a name of a 
file as parameters. The function should read the content of the file and store it in the StringSet.

The main program reads two documents, doc1.txt and doc2.txt, constructs two string sets which 
contains the words (strings) from these documents, and writes them out. The program then constructs 
the union of the two documents and writes it out. Thereafter, the program reads in a query from 
the file query.txt and writes it out. Then the size of the query is written out along with 
how many words of the query appear in the union. You can assume that all the files do not 
contain any punctuation characters.

Several conditions regarding StringSet that you need to fulfill:

    The class has a single constructor â€“ a default constructor.
    The class stores its strings in a private list (not a S et)
    The class has a __str__ for writing out the contents of a set.
    The class has a method which overloads the + operator for constructing the union of two sets.
