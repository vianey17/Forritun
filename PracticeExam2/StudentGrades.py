Write a Python program that manages grades for 4 students. 
Each student has a unique name and 3 grades.

The user should be able to input the name of each student and the corresponding grades for each student.
Next the program should print the names of each student in alphabetical order along with their grades.
Finally, the program should print the name of the student with the highest average grade along with 
he student's average grade. The average grade should be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

If two or more students have the same average grade the student that appears first in the alphabetical order should be printed.
